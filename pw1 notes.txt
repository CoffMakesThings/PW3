unsigned chart
rgba 8 bit

weight 1 - ouput 1-9
weight 1/9 - average
gaussian - gaussian filtering
laplacian - look it up - -1 except for center which is 8 - result -1 or 8

median filter - if 9x9 median is very different from center, center is noise
Make array of neighbours, sort, pick mid
replace center with median

if rgb
3 planes
do for r g and b as if theyre grayscale

Combine gaussian (average?) and median - Take average of mid 5 ie

shadermaterial not rawshader

ctrl shift i

cubic scaling instead of trillinear?

scale matrix


x, y => x*s, y*s

dont use texture2d, opengl's interpolation, dont know what happen

videoTexture.minFilter = THREE.NearestFilter;
not LinearFilter
Therefore no interpolation
